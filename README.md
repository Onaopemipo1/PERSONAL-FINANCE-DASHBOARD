## 4.0 - Data Transformation. 
Using Microsoft Excel, i had to properly check for the data type of the dataset. Although the dataset was cleaned already to allow for ease of usage. I also used pivot tables for better analaysis and created the graphs necessary. I performed the appropriate number and currency formats to help aid analysis. 

## 5.0 - Data Visualization.
Uisng Micrsoft Excel, i used the Pivot Table fucntion to extract important summaries which was necessary for the analysis. I also customized the pivot table by adding slicer which would affect everything on the table for the sake of interactivity.
